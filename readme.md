## Test Anonymizer for Moodle (a FireFox Addon)

I made this addon because I need to grade essay type questions in Moodle anonymously to make the grading fair. No matter how much I do not want to, seeing the students' names may affect how I grade and I do not want that. 

## Limitations
This was build for our implimentation of Moodle so it looks for moodle to be running in a moodle folder on your domain. 

## Use
This addon does two things to help with this approach. 
1. It add a link to the Manual Grading Page (for grading essay questions easier) to the quiz overview page. 
2. Hides all student names when grading the students reponses for a set essay question.

## Loading the Addon
To use this addon, download the code to a folder on your computer.

1. In the Firefox address bar, type `about:debugging` . This will bring up the Firefox debugging settings.
2. Find the **This Firefox** section and make sure it is selected. 
3. Click the **Load Temporary Addon** button. 
4. When the Open File Dialog opens, select and "open" any file in the folder where you downloaded these files. (I normally just "open" the manifest.json file.)

This Addon will now be active until you close Firefox. 
You will need to perform these steps each time you open Firefox and want to use this tool.
